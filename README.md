# Screenshot Narrator MCP

A fun MCP server that takes screenshots, describes what changed, generates hilarious narration, and plays it back as audio!

## Features

- **Get Screenshot**: Retrieves the last two screenshots from a directory
- **Describe**: Uses Claude to analyze screenshots and describe changes
- **Narrate**: Generates funny, sarcastic narration about what you're doing
- **TTS**: Converts narration to speech with OpenAI's TTS API
- **Auto-cleanup**: Only keeps the last 5 screenshots

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys
```

3. Get API keys:
   - Gemini API key: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (FREE!)
   - ElevenLabs API key: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys (10k chars/month free)

## Usage

### Run the Client

The client takes screenshots every 5 seconds and generates narrated audio:

```bash
python screenshot_client.py
```

This will:
1. Take a screenshot every 5 seconds
2. After 2 screenshots, compare them
3. Generate a funny narration about what changed
4. Convert to speech and play it automatically

### Use as MCP Server

You can also use this as an MCP server in Kiro or other MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenshot-narrator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_key",
        "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "your_key",
        "SCREENSHOT_DIR": "./screenshots"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Screenshots**: Uses macOS `screencapture` to grab screenshots
2. **Analysis**: Gemini 1.5 Flash analyzes images and describes changes (fast & free!)
3. **Narration**: Gemini generates sarcastic commentary
4. **Speech**: ElevenLabs TTS converts text to audio with high-quality voice
5. **Playback**: macOS `afplay` plays the audio
